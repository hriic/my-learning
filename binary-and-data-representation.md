# Binary System & Data Representation in Computers

## What is the Binary System?
The binary system is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Computers use binary because electronic circuits can easily represent two states: ON (1) and OFF (0).

Binary is the basic language of computers. All data inside a computer is stored and processed using binary numbers.

## Why Do Computers Use Binary?
- Easy to represent using electrical signals (on/off).
- Reliable and resistant to noise and errors.
- Simple and efficient for hardware design.

## Bits and Bytes
- Bit: The smallest unit of data, can be either 0 or 1.
- Byte: Consists of 8 bits.

Common data units:
- 1 Byte (B) = 8 bits
- 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1024 Bytes
- 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1024 KB
- 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1024 MB
- 1 Terabyte (TB) = 1024 GB

## Number Representation
Computers represent numbers in binary.

Examples:
- Decimal 5 = Binary 101
- Decimal 10 = Binary 1010
- Decimal 15 = Binary 1111

## Data Representation Types

### 1) Text Representation
Characters are represented using binary codes:
- ASCII: Represents characters using 7 or 8 bits.
- Unicode: Supports multiple languages and symbols.

Example:
- Letter A in ASCII = 65 (decimal) = 01000001 (binary)

### 2) Image Representation
Images are represented using pixels.
Each pixel is stored in binary to represent color and brightness.

- Black & White images: 1 bit per pixel
- Grayscale images: 8 bits per pixel
- Color images: 24 bits per pixel (RGB)

---

### 3) Audio Representation
Sound is represented by converting analog sound waves into digital signals using sampling and quantization.

Key concepts:
- Sampling rate (e.g., 44.1 kHz)
- Bit depth (e.g., 16-bit, 24-bit)

---

### 4) Video Representation
Video is a sequence of images (frames) displayed quickly to create motion.
Each frame is stored in binary form.

## Importance in Cybersecurity
Understanding binary and data representation helps in:
- Malware analysis.
- Reverse engineering.
- Memory analysis.
- Digital forensics.
- Understanding file formats and data structures.
