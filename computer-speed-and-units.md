# Computer Speed and Units

## 1. What is Computer Speed?
Computer speed refers to how fast a computer can process data and execute instructions.  
It is usually measured in **clock cycles** and **operations per second**.

- Faster computers execute more instructions in less time.
- Speed depends on CPU architecture, clock rate, memory, and system bus.

## 2. Clock Speed
- Measured in **Hertz (Hz)**: number of cycles per second.
- Common units:
  - 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second
  - 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz
  - 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz
  - 1 GHz = 1,000,000,000 Hz
- Example: CPU running at 3 GHz executes 3 billion cycles per second.

## 3. Instructions Per Second (IPS)
- Measures how many instructions a CPU can process per second.
- Higher IPS = faster performance.
- Units:
  - KIPS = Thousands of Instructions Per Second
  - MIPS = Millions of Instructions Per Second
  - GIPS = Billions of Instructions Per Second

## 4. Data Transfer Speed
- Speed of moving data between memory, CPU, and peripherals.
- Measured in **bits per second (bps)** or **bytes per second (Bps)**:
  - 1 Kbps = 1,000 bits/sec
  - 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits/sec
  - 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bits/sec
- Important for networking and storage devices.

| bps  | 1 bit/sec | Data transfer |
| Kbps | 1,000 bits/sec | Data transfer |
| Mbps | 1,000,000 bits/sec | Internet, network |
| Gbps | 1,000,000,000 bits/sec | High-speed network |

## 6. Notes
- CPU speed alone doesn’t guarantee overall computer performance.
- Memory speed, storage, bus speed, and software efficiency also matter.
- Understanding units helps in comparing hardware and system requirements.
