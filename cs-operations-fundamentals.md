# Operations In Computer — Summary

## 1) Arithmetic Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
Purpose: Perform mathematical calculations and numeric processing.

## 2) Logical Operations
- AND (&&)
- OR (||)
- NOT (!)
- XOR (^)
Purpose: Control decision making and program logic.

## 3) Bitwise Operations
- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)
- NOT (~)
- Left Shift (<<)
- Right Shift (>>)
Purpose: Low-level data manipulation, optimization, and memory control.

## 4) Comparison Operations
- Equal (==)
- Not Equal (!=)
- Greater Than (>)
- Less Than (<)
- Greater or Equal (>=)
- Less or Equal (<=)
Purpose: Used in conditions, loops, and branching.

## 5) Data Movement Operations
- Load (Memory → Register)
- Store (Register → Memory)
- Move (Register ↔ Register)
Purpose: Transfer data inside the computer system.

## 6) Control Flow Operations
- Jump
- Branch
- Loop
- Call / Return
Purpose: Control execution order of program instructions.

## 7) Input / Output Operations
