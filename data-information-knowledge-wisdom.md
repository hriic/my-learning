# Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW Model)

## Data
Data refers to raw facts and figures without any context or meaning. It is unprocessed and unorganized.

Examples:
- Numbers: 25, 100, 3.14
- Symbols: A, B, #
- Raw values: 36, 39, 41

Data alone does not provide understanding.

---

## Information
Information is processed and organized data that has meaning and context.

Examples:
- "The temperature is 36°C."
- "Student score is 85."

Information answers basic questions like:
Who? What? Where? When?

---

## Knowledge
Knowledge is the understanding gained from information through experience, learning, and analysis. It helps in decision-making.

Examples:
- Knowing that 36°C is a high temperature and may cause heat stress.
- Understanding that a score of 85 means very good performance.

Knowledge answers the question:
How?

---

## Wisdom
Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge in the right way, at the right time, and in the right situation. It involves judgment, insight, and experience.

Examples:
- Deciding to stay hydrated and avoid direct sunlight when temperature is high.
- Advising others on how to improve their performance based on experience.

Wisdom answers the question:
Why?
