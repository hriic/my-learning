# Variables & Constants — How Programs Store Data

## 1) Variables
- A **variable** is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.
- Each variable has:
  - Name
  - Data Type
  - Value

### Characteristics
- Value can be modified.
- Stored in memory (RAM).
- Used to hold temporary results and inputs.

### Examples
- int x = 10;
- float y = 3.14;
- char c = 'A';
- string name = "Yaman";

---

## 2) Constants
- A **constant** is a named memory location used to store data that **cannot be changed** during program execution.

### Characteristics
- Fixed value.
- Improves code readability and safety.
- Prevents accidental modification.

### Examples
- const int MAX = 100;
- final float PI = 3.14159;

## 3) Differences Between Variables and Constants

| Feature        | Variable | Constant |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Value Change   | Allowed   | Not Allowed |
| Flexibility    | High      | Limited     |
| Safety         | Medium    | High        |
| Use Case       | Temporary data | Fixed values |

## 4) Why Programs Use Variables & Constants
- Store user input.
- Store calculation results.
- Control program logic.
- Improve code organization and clarity.

---

## 5) Memory Storage Concept
- Variables and constants are stored in **RAM**.
- Each has a **specific memory address**.
- CPU accesses these memory locations during execution.

---

## 6) Best Practices
- Use **meaningful names**.
- Use constants for **fixed values**.
- Minimize unnecessary variables.
- Keep variable scope as small as possible.

## Learning Outcome
Understand how programs store, manage, and protect data using variables and constants.
