# Hexadecimal System in Computers

## What is the Hexadecimal System?
The hexadecimal system (Hex) is a number system with base 16. It uses 16 symbols to represent values:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

Where:
A = 10  
B = 11  
C = 12  
D = 13  
E = 14  
F = 15  

Hexadecimal is widely used in computers because it provides a compact and human-readable way to represent binary data.

## Why Do Computers Use Hexadecimal?
- Easier to read and write than long binary numbers.
- More compact representation of data.
- Commonly used in programming, memory addresses, and debugging.
- Each hexadecimal digit represents exactly 4 binary bits.

## Relationship Between Binary and Hexadecimal
Every hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 binary bits.

Examples:
- Binary 0000 = Hex 0
- Binary 0001 = Hex 1
- Binary 0010 = Hex 2
- Binary 1010 = Hex A
- Binary 1111 = Hex F

Example conversion:
- Binary: 11010110  
- Group into 4 bits: 1101 0110  
- Hex: D6

## Hexadecimal Number Examples
- Decimal 10 = Hex A
- Decimal 15 = Hex F
- Decimal 16 = Hex 10
- Decimal 255 = Hex FF
- Decimal 256 = Hex 100

## Where is Hexadecimal Used?
- Memory addresses (e.g., 0x7FFE)
- Color codes in web design (e.g., #FF5733)
- Debugging and reverse engineering
- Malware analysis
- Assembly language and low-level programming
