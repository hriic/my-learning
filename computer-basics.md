# Computer Basics Summary

## What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that takes input, processes data, and produces output. It can store, retrieve, and manipulate data to perform different tasks such as calculations, communication, and automation.

Main functions of a computer:
- Input: Receiving data (keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone)
- Processing: Handling data using the CPU
- Output: Displaying results (monitor, speakers, printer)
- Storage: Saving data for future use

## Hardware
Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer that you can see and touch.

Main hardware components:
- CPU (Central Processing Unit): The brain of the computer, responsible for processing instructions.
- RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary memory used to store data that is currently being used.
- Storage (HDD / SSD): Permanent memory used to store files, programs, and the operating system.
- Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects all components together.
- Power Supply (PSU): Provides electrical power to the computer.
- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): Handles graphics and visual processing.
- Input devices: Keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner, camera.
- Output devices: Monitor, speakers, printer.

## Software
Software refers to the programs and operating systems that run on the hardware.

Types of software:
1) System Software:
   - Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, macOS.
   - Responsible for managing hardware and system resources.

2) Application Software:
   - Programs used by users such as browsers, Microsoft Office, media players, programming tools.

3) Programming Software:
   - Tools used to create programs such as compilers, interpreters, IDEs (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

## Relationship Between Hardware and Software
Hardware and software work together. Hardware cannot function without software, and software cannot run without hardware. The operating system acts as a bridge between them.
