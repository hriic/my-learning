## 🧠 What Are Programming Levels?

Programming languages are classified into levels based on **how close they are to machine language or human language**.

---

# 🔹 1) Low-Level Languages

**Very close to machine language — Fast — Hard to learn**

### 📌 Examples:
- Machine Language (Binary: 0 & 1)
- Assembly Language

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- Very fast execution
- Full control over hardware
- Difficult to write and debug
- Platform dependent

### 🔐 Common Uses:
- Operating Systems
- Device Drivers
- Embedded Systems
- Malware Development
- Reverse Engineering

---

# 🔹 2) Mid-Level Languages

**Balance between performance and readability**

### 📌 Examples:
- C
- C++

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- Moderate difficulty
- High performance
- Access to hardware & memory
- Portable with some limitations

### 🔐 Common Uses:
- System Programming
- Game Development
- Cybersecurity Tools
- Performance-critical Applications

---

# 🔹 3) High-Level Languages

**Close to human language — Easy — Slower than low-level**

### 📌 Examples:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript
- C#
- PHP
- Ruby

### ⚙️ Characteristics:
- Easy to learn
- Fast development
- Platform independent
- Slower execution speed

### 🔐 Common Uses:
- Web Development
- Automation
- Scripting
- Data Science
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cybersecurity Scripting & Tools
