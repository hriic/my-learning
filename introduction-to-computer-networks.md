# Introduction to Computer Networks

## What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a group of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share data, resources, and services.

Networks allow devices to exchange information, access the internet, share files, and use common hardware such as printers and servers.

## Why Are Computer Networks Important?
- Sharing resources (files, printers, storage).
- Communication (email, messaging, video calls).
- Internet access.
- Centralized management and security.
- Collaboration and remote work.

## Types of Networks

### 1) LAN (Local Area Network)
- Covers a small area (home, school, office).
- High speed and low latency.
- Example: Home Wi-Fi network.

### 2) MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- Covers a city or large campus.
- Medium speed.
- Example: University network.

### 3) WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Covers large geographic areas (countries, continents).
- Slower than LAN.
- Example: The Internet.

## Network Topologies
Topology refers to how devices are connected in a network.

- Bus Topology  
- Star Topology  
- Ring Topology  
- Mesh Topology  

Most modern networks use **Star Topology**.

## Network Devices

- Router: Connects different networks and routes data packets.
- Switch: Connects devices within the same network.
- Hub: Simple device to connect multiple devices (rarely used today).
- Modem: Connects local network to the internet.
- Access Point (AP): Provides wireless network access.

## Network Transmission Media

### Wired:
- Twisted Pair Cable (UTP / STP)
- Coaxial Cable
- Fiber Optic Cable

### Wireless:
- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- Cellular Networks (4G, 5G)

## Network Models

### OSI Model (7 Layers)
1) Physical  
2) Data Link  
3) Network  
4) Transport  
5) Session  
6) Presentation  
7) Application  

### TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1) Network Access  
2) Internet  
3) Transport  
4) Application

## Basic Network Protocols
- IP: Addressing and routing.
- TCP: Reliable data transmission.
- UDP: Fast but unreliable transmission.
- HTTP / HTTPS: Web communication.
- FTP: File transfer.
- DNS: Converts domain names to IP addresses.

---

## IP Addressing
- IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:db8::1)

## Importance in Cybersecurity
Understanding computer networks helps in:
- Network security
- Penetration testing
- Firewall configuration
- Intrusion detection
- Traffic analysis
